## Introduction
Physics simulations are powerful tools for visualizing and understanding physical processes and phenomena. This repository includes simulations such as the Double-Slit Experiment and Cellular Automata, which help illustrate core concepts in quantum mechanics and complex systems.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following software installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Other dependencies as specified in the notebooks

## Installation
Clone the repository and install the required libraries:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hbarquanta/Physics-Simulations.git
cd Physics-Simulations
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To run the Jupyter notebooks, navigate to the repository directory and start Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Open the notebook you are interested in from the Jupyter interface.

## Contents

### Double-Slit Experiment
- **Double_Slit_Experiment.ipynb**: This notebook simulates the famous double-slit experiment, demonstrating the wave-particle duality of light and matter.

### Cellular Automata
- **Celular Automata.ipynb**: This notebook explores cellular automata, including the Game of Life, illustrating how simple rules can lead to complex behaviors.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you would like to improve the simulations or add new ones, please fork the repository and submit a pull request. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
